# Process Scheduling Simulation
## Data Structures (CS-218) Semester Project | Fall 2020
A graphical simulation of some popular CPU Scheduling Algorithms using the most appropriate data structures.
This Process Scheduling Simulator allows you to visualize how each scheduling algorithm ensures maximum throughput, minimum process response time, waiting time and turnaround time.
